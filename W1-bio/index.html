    <p style="width: 400px;"> one of my hobbies are playing videos games and I am part of the valorant team here at
        NEIT. Another hobby of mine is that I love cars. I love working on them and took a few classes at my highschool
        for it. I do all the work on my car myself and have "invested" hundreds of dollars in tools. Another thing I
        love with cars is watching them race, I love watching cars race whether it be F1, WRC, GT3,anything but nascar.
